# Route Ranker
Short: ranks route of x technicians to 1 customer.

## Description
This application is designed to assist in optimizing service technician travel routes. It takes five fixed addresses, which represent the residences of our company's service technicians. Whenever a new, sixth address (variable) is entered, the application calculates and ranks the car routes from this new address to each of the five fixed addresses, based on duration from shortest to longest.

## How It Works
- The user enters the variable address into an input field.
- The app calculates the routes from this address to the five fixed technician addresses.
- It then displays these routes in order of travel time duration, from shortest to longest.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Google Maps API (for route calculations)

## Future Enhancements
- Automatic address input through integration with a customer database.
- Real-time traffic data integration for more accurate route planning.
- A user-friendly interface for non-technical staff.

This project is in its initial stages and will evolve with more features and improvements over time.
